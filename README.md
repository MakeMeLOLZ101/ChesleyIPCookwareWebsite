Responsives for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile Version via figma 
Use of CSS systems and Framework for responsiveness - Grid, Flexbox and BootStrap
Use the following for at least one section of cards: Flex box, CSS Grid and bootstrap. For the flex box and grid sections there should be no bootstrap classes used.

No use of the bootstrap "card" class - IE creating your own cards  
Use CSS systems to style the site. But you must use each one at least one
